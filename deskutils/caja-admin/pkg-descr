Caja Admin is a simple Python extension for the Caja file manager that adds some
administrative actions to the right-click menu:

	- Open as Administrator: opens a folder in a new Caja window running with
	  administrator (root) privileges.

	- Edit as Administrator: opens a file in a Pluma window running with
	  administrator (root) privileges.

	- Run as Administrator: runs an executable file with administrator (root)
	  privileges inside a MATE Terminal.
