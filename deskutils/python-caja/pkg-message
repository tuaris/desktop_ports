As of python-caja 1.5.0, scripts are loaded only from
$XDG_DATA_DIR/caja-python/extensions, which includes ~/.local/share and
/usr/local/share (or whatever your $XDG_DATA_DIR is set to).

Copy scripts over to:

    $XDG_DATA_DIR/share/caja-python/extensions/
or:
    ~/.local/share/caja-python/extensions/

Then restart caja.
